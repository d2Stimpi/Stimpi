Prefab vs Entity
Entity:
-	Copying an entity makes a new entity with identical structure of Components having identical content
-	Modifying an entity changes relevant data only for that exact entity
Prefab:
-	Making an entity into a Prefab asset type allows for modifying multiple copies of entities by simply chaning the asset data
-	Modifying any instance of a Prefab will propagate all modifications to all entities that belong to that asset type

==== TODO List Items ====

Prefabs Editor:
-	Replacing prefab instance's parent prefab asset, by creating a new prefab asset with identical name as the existing one,
	preserving QuadComponent contents of all existing instances of prefab asset based on the name-basis of the asset.

Prefabs Scripting:
-	Drag-drop an entity to a valid script field should check if said entity is of a prefab type and if not prompt to create
	a prefab from the original drag-dropped entity
-	Drag-drop a Prefab asset on to Entity/Component script field

General Scripting:
-	Like Entity as a type field, any Comonent can be used as a reference to an Entity that has that specific Component
-	Entity as a type can hold any entity object reference and therefore instantiate it trough Instatiate API
	as a prefab (non asset?)

=========================



TODO Next:
- Fix animatio files, frame position is now used
- Make sure ExecTree is set when Scene is loaded
- Save local changes to active Scene while editing - AutoSave

** Script Engine **
- Expose C# properties to editor inspector

- Script component => asset that holds serializable field/attribute data 


Modify CircleComponent or remove compleatelly
